This Privacy Policy explains how Namo’s Taxi AB (“Namo’s Taxi”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application and related services (the “Services”).

2) Information we collect
a) You provide

Account details: name, email, phone number, profile photo (optional).

Payment setup: We never store full card numbers. Stripe tokenizes your card. We receive non-sensitive card metadata (brand, last4, expiry month/year) and Stripe IDs (customer & payment method).

Support content: messages, ratings, attachments you send us.

b) Collected automatically

Location data: precise GPS/Wi-Fi/cell tower location for pickup, routing, ETA, driver matching, and live trip tracking. “Always”/background location (if enabled) is used only to keep trip tracking/ETA accurate while the app is minimized during an active ride.

Device & usage: device model, OS/app version, language, IP, crash logs, diagnostics, and interaction events.

Maps/places: addresses, latitude/longitude, routes and ETAs via Google Maps Platform.

c) From third parties

Payments (Stripe): setup/charge status, risk checks, and non-sensitive card info (brand/last4/expiry).

Verification/fraud partners (if enabled): phone verification or fraud signals.

3) How we use your information

Provide the core Services (request rides, match drivers, live tracking, navigation, pricing, receipts).

Create/manage your account and preferences.

Process payments and prevent fraud (via Stripe).

Customer support and safety (trip history, issue investigation).

Service notifications (driver arrival, trip status, receipts). Marketing only with your consent.

Legal compliance and enforcing our Terms of Service.

Legal bases (EEA/UK): contract performance, legitimate interests (safety, fraud prevention, service improvement), consent (where required), and legal obligation.

4) Sharing & disclosure

We do not sell personal information.

We share only as needed:

Drivers: first name/initial, pickup/dropoff details, and your live location during an active trip.

Stripe (processor): to tokenize cards and process payments. See Stripe’s privacy notice at stripe.com/privacy.

Service providers: hosting, analytics, crash reporting, map services, customer support—bound by confidentiality and data-processing terms.

Legal/safety: to comply with laws, respond to lawful requests, protect rights, property, and safety.

Business transfers: if we undergo a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, data may transfer as allowed by law.

5) Data retention

Trip records/receipts: retained to meet tax, accounting, and regulatory requirements.

Payment identifiers: kept while your account is active and as needed for chargebacks/fraud prevention.

Location traces: retained for service provision and safety review, then minimized or anonymized where feasible.
We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes above or as required by law.

6) Your choices & rights

Access/Correction/Deletion: request a copy, corrections, or deletion (subject to legal retention).

Withdraw consent: for optional processing (e.g., marketing).

Object/Restrict: in certain cases you may object to or restrict processing.

Portability: receive your data in a portable format where applicable.

To exercise rights: email privacy@namos.taxi
. We may verify your identity.

EEA/UK: You may complain to your local Data Protection Authority (e.g., IMY in Sweden).
California (CCPA/CPRA): We do not “sell” personal info. You may request disclosures or deletion subject to exceptions.

7) Device permissions

Location: “While Using the App” (required to request rides); optionally “Always” for background updates during an active trip.

Camera (if used): profile photo, scanning cards (if enabled), or QR codes.

Notifications: trip updates, driver arrival, receipts; marketing only with consent.

You can manage permissions in device settings; some features may not work without them.

8) Payments & security

Stripe: Card data is encrypted and sent directly to Stripe; we never store full PAN/CVV. We store only Stripe references and non-sensitive metadata to display your saved card and complete charges.

Security measures: TLS encryption, access controls, least-privilege, monitoring, and periodic reviews. No system is 100% secure; contact support@namos.taxi
 if you suspect unauthorized activity.

9) International transfers

We may process/store data outside your country. When we transfer data internationally, we use lawful mechanisms (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) and additional safeguards where required.

10) Children’s privacy

The Services are not directed to children under 16 (or the age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided personal data, contact privacy@namos.taxi
 and we’ll delete it.

11) Analytics & cookies

We use mobile analytics and event tracking to improve performance and reliability. On the web, we may use cookies or similar technologies; you can manage cookies in your browser.

12) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We’ll post the updated Policy with a new effective date and, where required, notify you in-app or by email.
