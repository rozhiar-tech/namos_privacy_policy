Important notice about location data

Namo’s Taxi collects and uses your device’s precise location to provide the core functionality of the app.

Specifically:

We collect your precise location (via GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers) to:

show your position on the map,

find nearby drivers,

set pickup and dropoff points,

calculate routes, distance, time, and fares,

provide accurate ETAs and navigation,

allow live trip tracking for you and your driver.

If you allow “Always” / background location (e.g., “Allow all the time” or equivalent):

We continue to receive location updates during an active trip even if you minimize the app, switch to another app, or lock your phone.

Background location is used only to keep trip tracking, route progress, and ETAs accurate while a ride is in progress.

We do not use background location when there is no active trip.

We do not sell location data.

We do not use your precise location for unrelated third-party advertising.

You can change your location permission at any time in your device settings; however, the app cannot function properly (e.g., cannot request rides or show nearby drivers) without access to your location.

Information we collect
a) Information you provide

Account details: name, email, phone number, profile photo (optional).

Payment setup: We never store full card numbers. Stripe tokenizes your card. We receive non-sensitive card metadata (brand, last4, expiry month/year) and Stripe IDs (customer & payment method).

Support content: messages, ratings, attachments, and other information you send us when you contact support or leave feedback.

b) Information collected automatically

Location data:

Precise GPS/Wi-Fi/cell-tower location to:

determine your pickup and destination,

show nearby drivers,

calculate routes, distance, time, and fares,

provide live trip tracking and ETAs,

help with safety, dispute resolution, and fraud prevention.

Foreground location: collected when the app is open and you are using it (e.g., browsing the map, requesting or taking a ride).

Background location (if allowed):

If you grant “Always” / background permission, we receive location updates during an active trip even when the app is minimized or the screen is locked.

This is only to keep the ride running correctly (route, ETA, driver-rider coordination).

We do not keep tracking you in the background outside of an active ride.

Device & usage data: device model, operating system version, app version, language, IP address, crash logs, performance diagnostics, and basic interaction events (e.g., which screens are used).

Maps & places data: addresses, latitude/longitude, routes and ETAs generated via Google Maps Platform or similar mapping providers.

c) Information from third parties

Payments (Stripe): setup and charge status, risk checks, and non-sensitive card information (brand, last4, expiry).

Verification/fraud partners (if used): phone verification results or fraud risk signals.

How we use your information

We use the information described above, including location data, to:

Provide the core Services:

request rides,

match riders with drivers,

navigate and track trips in real time,

calculate prices and issue receipts.

Create and manage your account and preferences.

Process payments and prevent fraud (through Stripe and risk-management tools).

Provide customer support and safety features (trip history, investigating incidents or disputes).

Send service-related notifications (driver arrival, trip status, receipts).
Marketing messages are only sent with your consent where required.

Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.

Improve reliability, performance, and safety of the app (analytics, diagnostics).

Legal bases (EEA/UK):
We process data based on:

performance of a contract (providing the Services),

our legitimate interests (safety, fraud prevention, service improvement),

your consent (e.g., certain marketing or optional features),

and legal obligations (e.g., accounting and tax rules).

Sharing & disclosure

We do not sell your personal information.

We share your information only as reasonably necessary:

Drivers: During an active trip, drivers see your first name or initial, pickup and dropoff details, and live location needed to complete the ride safely and efficiently.

Stripe (processor): To tokenize cards and process payments. See Stripe’s privacy notice at stripe.com/privacy.

Service providers: Hosting, analytics, crash reporting, map services, and customer support tools. These providers are bound by confidentiality and data-processing agreements.

Legal/safety: Where required to comply with laws, respond to lawful requests, or protect rights, property, and safety of you, us, or others.

Business transfers: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred as allowed by law and subject to appropriate protections.

Data retention

Trip records and receipts: kept as required for tax, accounting, regulatory, and dispute-handling purposes.

Payment identifiers: kept while your account is active and as needed for chargebacks and fraud prevention.

Location data: kept for:

providing the current trip and related features (e.g., ETAs, route, safety review),

investigating safety or fraud issues,

limited analytics.
Where possible, we minimize or anonymize location data after it is no longer needed for the purposes above.

We retain data only as long as necessary for these purposes or as required by law.

Your choices & rights

Depending on your location and local laws, you have the right to:

Access your personal data and get a copy.

Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.

Request deletion of your data, subject to necessary legal/contractual retention.

Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent (e.g., marketing).

Object to or restrict certain processing, especially based on legitimate interests.

Data portability: receive certain data in a portable format where applicable.

To exercise your rights, contact us at privacy@namos.taxi
. We may need to verify your identity.

EEA/UK: You can also complain to your local Data Protection Authority (for example, IMY in Sweden).

California (CCPA/CPRA): We do not “sell” personal information as defined by law. You may request disclosures or deletion of your personal information, subject to statutory exceptions.

Device permissions

The app may request the following permissions:

Location (required for core functionality):

“While Using the App” – needed to find your location, show nearby drivers, pick up point, route, and ETA.

“Always” / background (optional but recommended for rides):

used to keep your trip running smoothly in the background (e.g., if you lock your phone or switch apps) while a ride is active.

not used when there is no active trip.

Camera (if used): for profile photos, scanning cards (if enabled), or QR codes.

Notifications: trip updates (driver arrival, trip start/end, receipts). Marketing notifications are sent only where legally allowed and can be disabled.

You can manage permissions in your device settings. If you disable location, the core ride-hailing functionality will not work.

Payments & security

Stripe payments: Card data is encrypted and sent directly to Stripe; we never store full card numbers (PAN) or CVV. We store only Stripe tokens/IDs and non-sensitive metadata to show your saved card and complete charges.

Security measures:
We use TLS encryption, access controls, least-privilege principles, logging, and security reviews. No system is 100% secure. If you suspect unauthorized activity, contact support@namos.taxi
 immediately.

International transfers

We may process and store information in countries other than your own. Where we transfer personal data internationally, we use lawful mechanisms (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) and additional safeguards as required by applicable law.

Children’s privacy

The Services are not directed to children under 16 (or the age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided personal data to us, contact privacy@namos.taxi
 and we will take steps to delete it where required.

Analytics & cookies

We use mobile analytics and in-app event tracking to understand usage patterns, improve performance, and fix bugs.

If you use our web pages, we may use cookies or similar technologies. You can control cookies through your browser settings; some features may not work correctly without them.

Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated Policy with a new effective date and, where required, notify you in the app or by email.
